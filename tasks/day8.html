            why whitespaces are not getting printed in the paragraph tag?
        </h3>
        <p>Why Are Multiple Whitespaces Collapsed?
            HTML treats sequences of multiple spaces, tabs, and newlines as a single space. This is part of its design to handle whitespace consistently across browsers.
            CSS white-space: normal:
            By default, most elements have the white-space property set to normal. This causes:
            Multiple spaces to collapse into one.
            Line breaks to wrap text normally.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>how the function get the event and the target area in the given example?
            function handelText(event){
                setText(event.target.value)
            }
        </h3>
        <p>When the function handelText is triggered (e.g., via an input field's onChange event), the browser automatically passes an event object to the function.
            The event object contains information about the event that occurred, such as:
            The type of event (change, click, etc.).
            The target property of the event object refers to the DOM element that triggered the event.
            The value property of event.target holds the current value of the input field (or any other form control) that triggered the event.

        <h3>how the Link component is converted to anchor tag and how classname is converted into class while inspecting the page</h3>
        <p>The Link component, when used in React (via react-router-dom), is not directly rendered as an anchor tag (<a>). 
            It uses React's JSX transformation to map to a real HTML <a> tag in the final rendered output.
            Internally, Link is a React component that uses React.createElement() (or JSX's React.createElement under the hood) to create an element.
            The Link component doesn't directly output the href attribute but outputs the to attribute,
            which is later converted into href.
            
            React uses className in JSX because class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript,
             but when React updates the actual DOM,
             it converts className into the class attribute, using standard DOM APIs like setAttribute().</p>
